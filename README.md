# odd-duck

The odd-duck project is an opportunity to use constructor functions and create a random generated batch of data to show.

A few people helped me: Matthew as he demoed on Tuesday, and what he did with Jacob with the class was helpful, and seeing it work was helpful.

A "company" is requesting data so they can have the knowledge of what product they should make next. We gathered clicks of images, and added a visual chart so the company can see the data easily. It is stored so they can have access to it for their next meeting.

This was a thourough exercise, using the random generator, blending more learning Javascript with chart.js and JSON.
